# Docco - docco documentation generator

It is a rewriten from scratch original docco generator, why i decide to rewrite it:

* Support of directories
* Depends only from node and strong libraries, no process.exec
* Support any language and any comments styles - multilines, onelines - just fill config file and point generator on it

You can see [examples](http://btd.github.com/docco/examples/index.html) of project that already used docco.

## Examle usage

Show help:

```
docco --help
```

Process one single file:

```
docco file.js
```
Will be created file in current directory with name file.js.html and docco.css. It is all. To specify output directory use `-o` option (strongly recommended for batch processing).

By default it uses C-style comments `/*! comment */` and `// ... \n`. So i am sure you want to use another type of comments - fill language configuration file and specify it with `-l` option.

For example i have such configuration file: 

```json
[
{
	"lang": "css",
	"comments": [["/*!", "*/"]],
	"files": ["\\.css$"] 
},
{
	"lang": "javascript",
	"comments": [["/*!", "*/"], ["//", "\n"]],
	"files": ["\\.js$"] 
},
{
	"comments": [["/*!", "*/"], ["//", "\n"]],
	"files": [".*"] 
}
]
```

It is array of objects. Each object should has 3 property: `lang` - it is `highlight.js` language for highlight, you can skip this argument and in this case will be used best matched, `comments` - it is obviously array or comments, each it is array with start and end, `files` - array of file patterns for this object configuration.

Example usage:

```
docco -l ./resources/languages.example.json ./lib/batch.js
```

## Batch processing

I strongly recommend add `-o` option for batch processing!!!

To unable batch processing you can do one of the following things:

* Specify more then one file for processing:

```
docco -l ./resources/languages.example.json -o ./docs ./lib/batch.js ./lib/single.js
```

* Specify directory or set of directories or files (the same as above but mixed).

* Specify option `-b`

* Specify option `--batch-config <path to batch config>`

First 3 cases uses default filters for directories - skip files which starts from `.`. Last case used when you want to specify your own filters.

Example of batch config:

```json
[
{
	"path": "./lib",
	"config": { },
	"filters": ["^\.[^\/].*", "\/\.[^\/]"]
}
]
```

So it is also array (you can add any numbers of entryes) with objects: `path` path to entry (usually directory), `config` - it is a language configuration for this entry (see example above), `filters` - it is array of strings, which will be excluded while traversing `path` location recusivly.

For this package i am generating docs with this command:

```
docco -o docs -l ./resources/languages.example.json --title "Docco - documentaion generator" ./lib
```
